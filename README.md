This **Housing Classification Project** is a machine learning project aimed at classifying housing data based on various features. Using powerful libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**, this project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, training, and evaluating classification models.
